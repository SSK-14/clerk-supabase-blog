## Getting Started

First, we will need to create a [Clerk project](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once that is setup now create a Supabase project which you can do by heading over to https://supabase.io.

## Development

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/SSK-14/clerk-supabase-blog
```

2. Install packages

```
npm install
```

3. Then we can create our environment file as follows:

```
# .env

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://__PROJECT_ID__.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API = "your-clerk-frontend-api"
```

4. Run the app

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.
